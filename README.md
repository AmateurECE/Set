<b>It's a Set!</b>
This is my implementation of a set, referring to the most fundamental discrete structure. It maintains the same properties of a mathematical set; it is unordered, and does not contain the same element more than once. You will see an example of this behavior in the set.c test file I have created. In the header file set.h, I have also bothered to implement all of the basic set operations: union, intersection, and subtraction. I did not implement the complement operation, as that would introduce too many extra problems. Union and Intersection are created here as variadic functions, and thus can operate on more than two sets at a time, with a minimum of one. It may be important to note that the null pointer is not accepted as the null set. Nothing is not the same as the set containing nothing. A handful of other set operations are included for convenience, such as set_issubset and set_isequal, which return boolean values. My plan is to use this library on a series of discrete mathematics programs, but we will see if that intention ever comes to fruition.
